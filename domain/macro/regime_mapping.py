    Confidence derivation order
    ---------------------------
    1. Hard floor conditions — always LOW regardless of quant support:
       - critical degraded status (``missing``, ``source_unavailable``)
       - stale or unknown freshness
    2. Partial / late conditions — floor at MEDIUM:
       - ``degraded_status = partial``
       - ``freshness_status = late``
    3. Unknown category states — one unknown → MEDIUM; two or more → LOW.
    4. Non-directional labels — ``mixed`` / ``unclear`` → always LOW.
    5. Quant score adjustment (applied only when quant_scores provided and
       preliminary confidence is HIGH or MEDIUM):
       - ``breadth < 0.60`` (fewer than 3 of 5 dimensions known) →
         cap at MEDIUM, cannot be HIGH.
       - ``overall_support < 0.40`` → downgrade HIGH → MEDIUM; MEDIUM → LOW
         (quant shows insufficient positive support for the current label).
       - ``overall_support >= 0.65`` and all states clean → confirm HIGH.
