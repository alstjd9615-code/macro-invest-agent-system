"""Contract (abstract base class) for feature-store repository adapters.

All concrete adapters — whether in-memory, SQLAlchemy-backed, or cloud-native
— must implement this contract.

Design notes
------------
* The contract is defined as an ABC to enable isinstance checks and to make
  missing-implementation errors explicit at construction time.
* All methods are **async** to support both synchronous stub adapters and
  future I/O-bound repository implementations without requiring callers to
  change.
* The repository is **append-friendly**: ``save_snapshot`` stores a new entry;
  ``get_latest_snapshot`` retrieves the most recent one.
