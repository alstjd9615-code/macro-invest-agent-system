"""Abstract repository interface for alert event persistence.

Implementations
---------------
* :class:`~adapters.repositories.in_memory_alert_store.InMemoryAlertStore`
  — used in development and tests.

Deferred
--------
* A SQL-backed implementation is planned for a future phase once durable
  persistence is required for audit trails and cross-restart history.
