"""LangChain prompt templates for agent summary formatting.

This module provides :class:`~langchain_core.prompts.ChatPromptTemplate`
instances for each agent operation.  In the current implementation the
templates are rendered **directly** (no LLM call) to produce deterministic
summaries.  When an LLM-backed formatting stage is introduced, these same
templates can be passed to a chat model without modification.

Design constraints
------------------
* Templates receive **only** structured data fields produced by MCP tools.
  They never override or reinterpret deterministic tool results.
* The rendered text is factual and conservative — it describes what the
  engine produced and never makes investment recommendations.
* All template variables are documented so callers can supply them without
  inspecting source code.
